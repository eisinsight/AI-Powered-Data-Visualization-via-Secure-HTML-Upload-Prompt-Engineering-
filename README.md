# 🔐 AI-Powered Data Visualization via Secure HTML Upload(Prompt Engineering)

This project enables secure, client-side data visualization using AI. Users convert Excel files to JSON, upload a sample to an HTML webpage, and receive dynamic visualizations generated by AI. No server-side processing—your data stays local.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Secure by Design**: All processing happens in-browser. No data leaves your machine.
- 🤖 **AI-Driven Visualization**: Upload a few rows of JSON and let AI generate a responsive HTML dashboard.
- 🎨 **Prompt-Engineered Styling**: Customize layout, chart types, and UI styles (e.g., neumorphism, glassmorphism) via AI prompts.
- 📄 **Modular Workflow**: Easily swap datasets and regenerate visualizations.

## 🧩 Workflow Overview

### 1. Convert Excel to CSV

Use Excel or Google Sheets to export your `.xlsx` file as `.csv`.

### 2. Convert CSV to JSON

You can use any online tool or the following Python script in Jupyter Notebook:

```python
import csv
import json

# Define full paths
csv_file_path = r'C:\Users\##########.cs'
json_file_path = r'C:\Users\##########.json'

# Clean function to strip bad characters
def clean_row(row):
    return {
        k: (v.encode('utf-8', errors='ignore').decode('utf-8') if isinstance(v, str) else v)
        for k, v in row.items()
    }

# Read, clean, and convert line-by-line
with open(csv_file_path, mode='r', encoding='utf-8', errors='replace') as csv_file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file)
    with open(json_file_path, mode='w', encoding='utf-8') as json_file:
        for row in reader:
            row = clean_row(row)
            json.dump(row, json_file)
            json_file.write('\n')  # newline-delimited JSON
```

> 🔧 Modify `csv_file_path` and `json_file_path` to match your local file paths.

## 🌐 HTML Upload Page

Use the AI to generate a basic HTML page by providing the first 2–3 rows of your JSON file. Example prompt:

> “Create an HTML webpage that accepts a JSON upload and visualizes the data using charts. Here are the first 3 rows…”

Once generated, upload your full JSON file to the webpage. The AI will render visualizations such as:

- 📊 Bar charts
- 📈 Line graphs
- 🧮 Pie charts
- 🗂️ Custom dashboards

You can refine the layout and style by prompting the AI with instructions like:

> “Make the dashboard neumorphic with soft shadows and rounded corners.”

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- ✅ No backend or server calls.
- ✅ No third-party data storage.
- ✅ All visualization logic runs in-browser.
- ✅ Ideal for sensitive or executive-level datasets.

## 📁 Sample JSON (First 3 Rows)

```json
{"Name": "Product A", "Sales": "1200", "Region": "North"}
{"Name": "Product B", "Sales": "950", "Region": "South"}
{"Name": "Product C", "Sales": "1430", "Region": "East"}
```

## 🧠 Prompt Engineering Tips

- Use clear, structured prompts to guide AI layout.
- Mention chart types, color schemes, and UI styles.
- Include branding elements like suptitles and logos if needed.

## 🌟 Vision & Purpose

This project reflects a new era of data visualization—where AI, design, and security converge to empower creators. It’s built for strategists, analysts, and executives who demand:

- 🔒 Full control over their data
- 🎬 Cinematic, branded visualizations
- ⚡ Rapid iteration with AI assistance
- 🧠 Intelligent workflows that scale

Whether you're pitching to stakeholders or refining internal dashboards, this framework helps you turn raw data into compelling, secure visual narratives.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

The HTML webpage included in this repository is specifically designed to visualize the sample JSON file provided here. It will only work correctly with that dataset.

If you want to visualize a different dataset:

- 🛠️ You must generate a new HTML webpage using the same workflow outlined above.
- 📄 Provide the first 2–3 rows of your new JSON file to the AI.
- 🎨 Customize the layout and styling as needed via prompt engineering.

> This ensures accurate rendering, secure handling, and tailored visualization for each unique dataset.
