# 🔐 AI-Powered Data Visualization via Secure HTML Upload(Prompt Engineering)

This project enables secure, client-side data visualization using AI. Users convert Excel files to JSON, upload a sample to an HTML webpage, and receive dynamic visualizations generated by AI. No server-side processing—your data stays local.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Secure by Design**: All processing happens in-browser. No data leaves your machine.
- 🤖 **AI-Driven Visualization**: Upload a few rows of JSON and let AI generate a responsive HTML dashboard.
- 🎨 **Prompt-Engineered Styling**: Customize layout, chart types, and UI styles (e.g., neumorphism, glassmorphism) via AI prompts.
- 📄 **Modular Workflow**: Easily swap datasets and regenerate visualizations.

## 🧩 Workflow Overview

### 1. Convert Excel to CSV

Use Excel or Google Sheets to export your `.xlsx` file as `.csv`.

### 2. Convert CSV to JSON

You can use any online tool or the following Python script in Jupyter Notebook:

```python
import csv
import json

# Define full paths
csv_file_path = r'C:\Users\##########.cs'
json_file_path = r'C:\Users\##########.json'

# Clean function to strip bad characters
def clean_row(row):
    return {
        k: (v.encode('utf-8', errors='ignore').decode('utf-8') if isinstance(v, str) else v)
        for k, v in row.items()
    }

# Read, clean, and convert line-by-line
with open(csv_file_path, mode='r', encoding='utf-8', errors='replace') as csv_file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file)
    with open(json_file_path, mode='w', encoding='utf-8') as json_file:
        for row in reader:
            row = clean_row(row)
            json.dump(row, json_file)
            json_file.write('\n')  # newline-delimited JSON
```

> 🔧 Modify `csv_file_path` and `json_file_path` to match your local file paths.

## 🌐 HTML Upload Page

Use the AI to generate a basic HTML page by providing the first 2–3 rows of your JSON file. Example prompt:

> “Create an HTML webpage that accepts a JSON upload and visualizes the data using charts. Here are the first 3 rows…”

Once generated, upload your full JSON file to the webpage. The AI will render visualizations such as:

- 📊 Bar charts
- 📈 Line graphs
- 🧮 Pie charts
- 🗂️ Custom dashboards

You can refine the layout and style by prompting the AI with instructions like:

> “Make the dashboard neumorphic with soft shadows and rounded corners.”

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- ✅ No backend or server calls.
- ✅ No third-party data storage.
- ✅ All visualization logic runs in-browser.
- ✅ Ideal for sensitive or executive-level datasets.

## 📁 Sample JSON (First 3 Rows)

```json
{"Name": "Product A", "Sales": "1200", "Region": "North"}
{"Name": "Product B", "Sales": "950", "Region": "South"}
{"Name": "Product C", "Sales": "1430", "Region": "East"}
```
